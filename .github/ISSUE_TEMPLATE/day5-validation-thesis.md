## ✅ Engineering Gate (15 minutes)
- [ ] 15-minute continuous operation
- [ ] 100% reliability (no errors)
- [ ] All 6 joints operational
- [ ] Timing within budget
- [ ] Log performance metrics

## ✅ Thesis Gate (30 minutes)
- [ ] 30-minute operation under full load
- [ ] Execute complex trajectories
- [ ] MoveIt integration test
- [ ] Collision avoidance validation
- [ ] Video documentation

## ✅ Fault Injection Testing
- [ ] ESP32 disconnect recovery
- [ ] Packet loss simulation
- [ ] Controller restart recovery
- [ ] Emergency stop test

## 📊 Success Criteria
- [ ] Engineering gate: PASS
- [ ] Thesis gate: PASS
- [ ] All fault scenarios handled safely
- [ ] Performance data collected
- [ ] Video evidence captured

## 📚 Thesis Documentation
- [ ] Formal validation report (PDF)
