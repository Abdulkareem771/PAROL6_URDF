# PAROL6 ROS 2 Project Explanation

Welcome! This document is designed to explain the PAROL6 ROS 2 project from the bottom up. It is written for beginners who want to understand how all the pieces fit together to control a robot arm using ROS 2.

## 🏗️ 1. The Foundation: Docker Environment

Before we touch any robot code, we need a computer environment to run it. We use **Docker** for this. Think of Docker as a "virtual computer" that lives inside your laptop. It ensures that everyone (you and your colleagues) has the exact same software versions, so "it works on my machine" is always true.

### 📄 File: `Dockerfile`
This file is the "recipe" for building that virtual computer.

```dockerfile
# 1. Base Image: Start with a version of Linux (Ubuntu) that has ROS 2 Humble pre-installed.
FROM osrf/ros:humble-desktop

# 2. Install Dependencies: Add extra tools we need, like Gazebo (simulator) and MoveIt (motion planning).
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    ros-humble-gazebo-ros-pkgs \       # Connects ROS 2 to Gazebo
    ros-humble-gazebo-ros2-control \   # Allows ROS 2 to control Gazebo motors
    ros-humble-moveit \                # Motion planning library
    ros-humble-rviz2 \                 # 3D Visualization tool
    gazebo \                           # The simulator itself
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*     # Clean up to keep image small

# 3. Workspace: Create a folder where our code will live inside the container.
WORKDIR /workspace

# 4. Auto-Source: Make sure ROS 2 commands are available every time we open a terminal.
RUN echo "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc

# 5. Default Command: When the container starts, give us a bash terminal.
CMD ["/bin/bash"]
```

## 🤖 2. The Body: Robot Description (URDF)

Now that we have an OS, we need to tell ROS what our robot looks like. We use **URDF** (Unified Robot Description Format), which is an XML file.

### 📄 File: `PAROL6/urdf/PAROL6.urdf`
This file defines the **Links** (solid parts) and **Joints** (moving hinges) of the robot.

#### A. Defining a Link (A solid part)
```xml
<link name="base_link">
  <!-- 1. Inertial: Mass and center of gravity (needed for physics simulation) -->
  <inertial>
    <mass value="0.812" />
    <inertia ixx="0.001" ... /> 
  </inertial>

  <!-- 2. Visual: What it looks like (3D mesh) -->
  <visual>
    <geometry>
      <mesh filename="package://parol6/meshes/base_link.STL" />
    </geometry>
  </visual>

  <!-- 3. Collision: The physical shape for bumping into things (often same as visual) -->
  <collision>
    <geometry>
      <mesh filename="package://parol6/meshes/base_link.STL" />
    </geometry>
  </collision>
</link>
```

#### B. Defining a Joint (A hinge)
```xml
<joint name="joint_L1" type="revolute">
  <!-- 1. Parent and Child: Connects base_link to Link 1 -->
  <parent link="base_link" />
  <child link="L1" />

  <!-- 2. Axis: Rotates around the Z axis (0 0 1) -->
  <axis xyz="0 0 1" />

  <!-- 3. Limits: Can rotate from -1.7 to +1.7 radians -->
  <limit lower="-1.7" upper="1.7" effort="300" velocity="3" />
</joint>
```

#### C. The Brain Interface: `ros2_control`
This special section tells ROS how to talk to the motors (or simulated motors).

```xml
<ros2_control name="IgnitionSystem" type="system">
  <hardware>
    <!-- Use the Ignition Gazebo plugin to simulate hardware -->
    <plugin>ign_ros2_control/IgnitionSystem</plugin>
  </hardware>
  
  <joint name="joint_L1">
    <!-- We can send POSITION commands to this joint -->
    <command_interface name="position">
      <param name="min">-1.7</param>
      <param name="max">1.7</param>
    </command_interface>
    <!-- We can read the current POSITION from this joint -->
    <state_interface name="position"/>
  </joint>
  ...
</ros2_control>
```

---

## 🚀 3. The Launcher: Starting the World

We have a computer (Docker) and a robot (URDF). Now we need to start the simulation.

### 📄 File: `start_ignition.sh`
This is a Bash script (like a batch file) that automates the complex startup process.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# 1. Enable Graphics: Allow the Docker container to show windows on your screen.
xhost +local:docker > /dev/null 2>&1

# 2. Start Docker: Run the image we built, mounting our code folder (/workspace).
docker run -d --rm \
  --name parol6_dev \
  --network host \
  --privileged \
  -v /home/kareem/Desktop/PAROL6_URDF:/workspace \
  parol6-ultimate:latest \
  tail -f /dev/null

# 3. Build Code: Compile the ROS packages inside the container.
docker exec parol6_dev bash -c "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash && cd /workspace && colcon build"

# 4. Launch ROS: Run the main launch file.
docker exec -it parol6_dev bash -c "
  source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash && \
  source /workspace/install/setup.bash && \
  ros2 launch parol6 ignition.launch.py
"
```

## 🧠 4. The Planner: MoveIt & RViz

While `ros2_control` moves the motors, **MoveIt** decides *how* to move them to avoid collisions and reach a goal.

### 📄 File: `parol6_moveit_config/config/parol6.srdf`
The SRDF (Semantic Robot Description Format) adds "meaning" to the URDF.

```xml
<robot name="parol6">
    <!-- 1. Groups: Defines "parol6_arm" as the chain from base_link to L6 -->
    <group name="parol6_arm">
        <chain base_link="base_link" tip_link="L6"/>
    </group>

    <!-- 2. Poses: Pre-defined positions like "home" -->
    <group_state name="home" group="parol6_arm">
        <joint name="joint_L1" value="0"/>
        ...
    </group_state>

    <!-- 3. Collisions: Tells MoveIt which parts can safely touch (e.g., adjacent links) -->
    <disable_collisions link1="L1" link2="L2" reason="Adjacent"/>
</robot>
```

### 📄 File: `parol6_moveit_config/config/kinematics.yaml`
This tells MoveIt which math solver to use to calculate joint angles from a 3D position (Inverse Kinematics).

```yaml
parol6_arm:
  kinematics_solver: kdl_kinematics_plugin/KDLKinematicsPlugin
  kinematics_solver_search_resolution: 0.005
```

### 👁️ RViz (Visualization)
RViz is the 3D tool you see. It subscribes to topics like `/joint_states` and `/robot_description` to draw the robot in 3D space. It allows you to drag the robot arm to set goals for MoveIt.

## 🎮 5. The Controller: Xbox Direct Control

Finally, we want to move the robot with an Xbox controller. This is where our Python script comes in.

### 📄 File: `xbox_direct_control.py`
This script acts as a "bridge". It listens to the Xbox controller and sends commands to the robot.

#### A. Setup and Connections
```python
class XboxDirectControl(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('xbox_direct_control')
        
        # 1. Action Client: The way we send commands to the robot controller.
        # We send a "trajectory" (a path of movement).
        self._action_client = ActionClient(self, FollowJointTrajectory, '/parol6_arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory')
        
        # 2. Subscriber: Listen to the Xbox controller inputs.
        self.joy_sub = self.create_subscription(Joy, 'joy', self.joy_callback, 10)
        
        # 3. Subscriber: Listen to where the robot currently IS (Joint States).
        self.joint_sub = self.create_subscription(JointState, 'joint_states', self.joint_state_callback, 10)
```

#### B. The Logic Loop (`joy_callback`)
This function runs every time you move a joystick.

```python
    def joy_callback(self, msg):
        # 1. Map Joystick Axes to Robot Joints
        # msg.axes[0] is the Left Stick Horizontal
        # self.target_positions[0] is Joint 1
        self.target_positions[0] -= msg.axes[0] * self.speed_scale

        # 2. Safety Limits: Don't let the robot hit itself (Software Limit)
        self.target_positions[0] = max(-3.14, min(3.14, self.target_positions[0]))
        
        # 3. Send the Command
        self.send_goal()
```

#### C. Sending the Command (`send_goal`)
```python
    def send_goal(self):
        goal_msg = FollowJointTrajectory.Goal()
        
        # Create a trajectory point (where we want to be 0.2 seconds from now)
        point = JointTrajectoryPoint()
        point.positions = self.target_positions
        point.time_from_start = Duration(sec=0, nanosec=200000000) # 200ms
        
        # Send it!
        goal_msg.trajectory.points.append(point)
        self._action_client.send_goal_async(goal_msg)
```

## 🎓 8. How to Expand: Building Robust Robotics

You mentioned you want to build a **robust** system for your thesis. Here is the roadmap to go from "Direct Control" to "Intelligent Robotics".

### A. Switch to MoveIt (The "Right" Way)
Currently, `xbox_direct_control.py` moves the robot blindly. If there is a wall, it will hit it. To fix this, you should use the **MoveIt MoveGroup Interface**.

**What to do:**
1.  Create a new Python script (e.g., `smart_planner.py`).
2.  Use the `moveit_commander` library (Python) or `moveit_cpp` (C++).
3.  Instead of calculating joint angles yourself, you say: "Go to [X, Y, Z]".
4.  MoveIt will:
    *   Check for collisions.
    *   Plan a smooth path around obstacles.
    *   Execute the path.

**Code Snippet (Python Example):**
```python
import moveit_commander

# Initialize
group = moveit_commander.MoveGroupCommander("parol6_arm")

# Set a target (e.g., 20cm forward)
group.set_position_target([0.2, 0.0, 0.4])

# Plan and Execute
plan = group.go(wait=True)
group.stop()
```

### B. Add Perception (Eyes)
A robot is blind without sensors.
1.  **Add a Camera**: Add a RealSense or Kinect camera to your URDF.
2.  **Octomap**: Configure MoveIt to read the camera's PointCloud. MoveIt will automatically build a 3D map of the world (Octomap) and avoid obstacles dynamically.

### C. Add a Gripper
1.  Update URDF to include a gripper link.
2.  Add a new `ros2_control` interface for the gripper.
3.  Use MoveIt to plan "Pick and Place" tasks.

### D. State Machines (Behavior)
For complex tasks (e.g., "Pick up cup, if heavy, put it down"), don't use `if/else` in Python. Use a **Behavior Tree**.
*   **Tools**: `BehaviorTree.CPP` or `py_trees_ros`.
*   This allows you to create modular, reusable behaviors.

## 📚 Next Steps for Learning

1.  **Modify the Speed**: Change `self.speed_scale` in `xbox_direct_control.py` to make it faster or slower.
2.  **Change Mappings**: Swap which joystick axis controls which joint.
3.  **Add a Button**: Make the "A" button (index 0 in `msg.buttons`) reset the robot to the home position (all zeros).

---

## 🧠 9. Deep Dive: Mastering MoveIt 2

For your thesis, you need to understand **MoveIt 2** deeply. It is the industry standard for robot manipulation.

### A. How MoveIt Works (The Architecture)
MoveIt is not just one node; it's a collection of plugins managed by the **`move_group`** node.

1.  **The `move_group` Node**: The central brain. It doesn't "think" itself; it coordinates other plugins.
2.  **Planning Scene**: A 3D representation of the world. It contains:
    *   The Robot (URDF + Joint States).
    *   Static Objects (Tables, Walls).
    *   Dynamic Objects (Humans, other robots).
3.  **Planners (OMPL)**: The math engines. When you say "Go to Point B", OMPL (Open Motion Planning Library) tries thousands of random paths until it finds one that doesn't hit anything.
    *   *Common Algorithms*: RRTConnect (fast), PRM (good for complex mazes).

### B. Connecting External Devices

#### 1. Xbox Controller (Real-Time Servoing)
For smooth, real-time control (teleoperation), you don't use "Planning" (which takes seconds). You use **`moveit_servo`**.
*   **How it works**: It takes joystick input (`Twist` messages) and calculates Inverse Kinematics (IK) *fast* (500Hz) to move the robot incrementally.
*   **Setup**:
    1.  Run `joy_node` to publish `/joy`.
    2.  Run a bridge node (like `xbox_to_servo.py`) to convert `/joy` to `/servo/delta_twist_cmds`.
    3.  Run `servo_node` which listens to twist commands and sends joint commands to the robot.

#### 2. Mobile ROS App (Foxglove / Rviz Mobile)
To control the robot from a phone/tablet:
*   **The Bridge**: You need **`rosbridge_suite`**. It converts ROS messages to WebSockets (JSON).
    ```bash
    sudo apt install ros-humble-rosbridge-suite
    ros2 launch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket_launch.xml
    ```
*   **The App**: Connect the app to your computer's IP address (e.g., `ws://192.168.1.100:9090`).
*   **Data Flow**: App -> WebSocket -> `rosbridge` -> `/move_group/goal` -> Robot.

#### 3. External Programs (Python/C++)
To send commands from another script (e.g., an AI model):
*   **Python**: Use `moveit_commander`.
    ```python
    commander = MoveGroupCommander("parol6_arm")
    commander.set_named_target("home")
    commander.go()
    ```
*   **C++**: Use `moveit::planning_interface::MoveGroupInterface`. This is faster and safer for industrial use.

### C. 3D Perception (Xbox Kinect / RealSense)
To make the robot "see" and avoid obstacles dynamically:

1.  **Hardware Driver**: Install the ROS 2 driver for your camera.
    *   *Xbox 360 Kinect*: `freenect_stack`
    *   *Azure Kinect*: `Azure_Kinect_ROS_Driver`
    *   *RealSense*: `realsense-ros`
2.  **Data Stream**: The camera publishes a **PointCloud2** topic (e.g., `/camera/depth/points`). This is a massive list of 3D dots.
3.  **Octomap**: MoveIt has a plugin called "Occupancy Map Updater".
    *   You edit `sensors_3d.yaml` in your MoveIt config.
    *   MoveIt reads the PointCloud and builds an **Octomap** (Minecraft-like voxels) in the Planning Scene.
    *   **Result**: If you put your hand in front of the robot, MoveIt sees "voxels" appear and will plan paths *around* your hand.

### D. Curated Resources (The "Gold Mine")

Here are the best places to learn:

1.  **Official MoveIt 2 Tutorials** (The Bible)
    *   [moveit.picknik.ai](https://moveit.picknik.ai/humble/index.html)
    *   *Start with*: "Your First C++ MoveIt Project" and "Move Group Python Interface".

2.  **The Construct (ROS 2 Courses)**
    *   [theconstructsim.com](https://www.theconstructsim.com/)
    *   Excellent interactive courses on ROS 2 Navigation and Manipulation.

3.  **ROS 2 Design Patterns**
    *   [design.ros2.org](https://design.ros2.org/)
    *   Understand *why* ROS 2 works the way it does (DDS, Nodes, Lifecycle).

4.  **GitHub Examples**
    *   Look at `panda_moveit_config` (Frank Emika) or `ur_ros2_driver` (Universal Robots) to see "Professional" configurations.

Happy Coding! 🚀
